CSCI 401 Operating Systems
Project 1, Part 1 - A Linked List in the C programming langauge.

Author: Fleurevca Francois
Description: This project requests that a C-string linked list data structure for storing character strings is created.
It includes functions that will enable you to create a list, add items to a list, removes item from the list, print the list,
flush or free the list. 

Compiling and Running the Program:
- In a Linux or Mac based system run "make" in the main directory to make sure the executable file is up-to-date. Afterwards, run "./output" in the command line.
- In a Windows, a linux-based subsystem needs to be downloaded and once that is up and running, follow the same steps as in a Linux/Mac system.

Challenges:
- Learning the C langauge and learning to create a Makefile.
